In this code:
1.Local variable:There are no any Local variable in this code fragment because there
               are no variable defined inside a funtion
2.Global Variable:space_invaders,player_pos,level,max_level are global variables because
                they are defined outside the function and can be accessed from within the function play()
3.Built_in_function: len() is a built_in_function in python
